#D-DAY-2

The exhausted French army are trying to do a final attack on our post in Normandy.
Play as a German Officer " Cpt. Herbert von Wolfe " and defend your bunker at any cost until the reinforcements arrive.
The bunker is equipped with an MG-42 and enough ammunition that you can survive for a week.
Good Luck.....
